## Gruvbox

This is a work in progress. It is my attempt to get the
[gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) color scheme ported to Intellij.

I used the [emacs port](https://github.com/Greduan/emacs-theme-gruvbox) as a
starting point and plan to get this included in the
[gruvbox-contrib](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-contrib) repo.

### Installation

At the moment I don't have any releases, so in order to use the color scheme,
you have clone this repository. After that, go to "Color Scheme" in the Intellij
settings

click on the ![](https://imgur.com/9DVPx5h.png)-icon to the right of the color
scheme drop-down, select "Intellij IDEA color scheme" from the "Import Scheme"
submenu

now navigate to the repository and select the file "gruvbox-light.icls" or
"gruvbox-dark.icls". Click "Apply" and that's it!

### <a name="contributing">Contributing</a>

Yes please! I'm not a dark interface person, so I'd most appreciate work on
gruvbox dark, but support on either of the schemes is appreciated.

When making changes that you'd like to see included in future
versions of this, please follow the usual, fork, branch, pull request process.
Your branch should be up to date with the current master and have a clear
description of the changes.
