## Gruvbox Light

This is a work in progress. It is my attempt to get the [gruvbox
light](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) color scheme ported to Intellij.

I used the [emacs port](https://github.com/Greduan/emacs-theme-gruvbox) as a
starting point and plan to get this port included in the
[gruvbox-contrib](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-contrib) repo.

### Installation

At the moment I don't have any releases, so in order to use the color scheme,
you have clone this repository. After that, go to "Color scheme" in the Intellij
settings

click on the ![](https://imgur.com/9DVPx5h.png)-icon to the right of the color
scheme drop-down, select "Intellij IDEA color scheme" from the "Import Scheme"
submenu

now navigate to the repository and select the file "gruvbox-light.icls". Click
"Apply" and that's it!

### Why only gruvbox light?

There seems to already be a port of gruvbox dark
[here](http://color-themes.com/?view=theme&id=58f37735cc35aa1b00dba6a4) and
since I prefer light themes, this was the first "itch I scratched". I'll
probably add the dark theme at some point, or you could [contribute
it](#contributing) yourself :)
