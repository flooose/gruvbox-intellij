## Gruvbox Light

This is a work in progress. It is my attempt to get the [gruvbox
light](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) color scheme ported to Intellij.

I used the [emacs port](https://github.com/Greduan/emacs-theme-gruvbox) as a
starting point and plan to get this port included in the
[gruvbox-contrib](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox-contrib) repo.

### Why only gruvbox light?

There seems to already be a port of gruvbox dark
[here](http://color-themes.com/?view=theme&id=58f37735cc35aa1b00dba6a4) and
since I prefer light themes, this was the first "itch I scratched". I'll
probably add the dark theme at some point, or you could [contribute
it](#contributing) yourself :)
